This To-Do List application is a simple and intuitive web-based tool built using Angular, designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. 
Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. 
When a task is marked as done, it gets crossed out visually to indicate completion. 
The app also saves data so that tasks remain available after refreshing the page.
